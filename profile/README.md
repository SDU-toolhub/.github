## Tools useful to SDUers

We seek for useful tools related with SDU all over GitHub and fork them under this Organization. We will also open new projects when we need to use them. Members can also transfer projects they are not going to maintain actively to the community. We wish the projects here live long and get maintained by us, an always refreshing community.

We will try our best to maintain the projects, time permitting. We shall try to fix bugs, and sync the forks with the source regularly.

If you are interested in this, please consider joining us to make life in SDU easier together, with technology and codes.

Contact the current main maintainer of this organization @ViSh-u-lucky, via [email](mailto:vs0323@asia.com) or go to the [discussion page](https://github.com/orgs/SDU-toolhub/discussions).

Even though the organization may not attract many of you, we are still here waiting for you. Welcome!
