## Seek for tools on GitHub related to SDU

We seek for useful tools related with SDU all over SDU and fork then under this Organization.

We will try our best to maintain the projects, time permitting. We shall try to fix bugs, and sync the forks with the source regularly.

If you are interested in this, please consider joining us to make life in SDU easier together, with technology and codes.

Contact the current main maintainer of this project @ViSh-u-lucky, via [email](mailto:vs0323@asia.com) or go to the discussion page.

Even though the organization may not attract many of you, we are still here waiting for you. Welcome!
